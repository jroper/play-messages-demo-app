# Play Messages demo app

This is the final state of my Play messages demo app that I produce in my All Work No Play Doesn't Scala presentation.

It is based off the play-mongo-knockout activator template, which is a reactive rich front end app.

The `Messages Presentation.xml` file is the IntelliJ live templates file that defines all my live templates that I use during the application, this means I don't have to fumble around trying to get code right while talking at the same time.
